### Hey there, I'm Eliud! 👋  

I'm a **developer, techpreneur, and creative thinker** exploring the intersections of **software development, data science, and automation**. With a natural inclination for abstract reasoning, framework-driven thinking, and the pursuit of optimal solutions, I see software development as more than just writing code—it's an extension of thought, a way to model and bring ideas to life.  

💡 My work blends **curiosity**, **systems thinking**, and **creative execution**.  
🔥 I’m on a mission to master **full-stack development**, **AI**, and **high-performance computing**, continuously optimizing my skills along the way.  

### 🔧 Tech Stack  
- 💻 **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL  
- 🚀 **Backend:** Django, FastAPI, Node.js  
- 🎨 **Frontend:** React, Next.js, jQuery  
- 🛢️ **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite  
- 📈 **Data & AI:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow  
- ⚙️ **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD  

### 🧩 My Journey Into Code  
It all started with writing simple Python scripts—small tools to automate everyday tasks. But the more I built, the more I realized software development is about more than just code. It's a creative outlet for problem-solving, a way to break things down, optimize, and rebuild them better.  
As I dived deeper, I began to see how different pieces fit together to form frameworks, uncovering deeper patterns in how systems work. This obsession with structure naturally led me into data science and AI, where logic meets intelligence, and raw data transforms into powerful insights. Today, I build full-stack applications, design intelligent systems, and optimize workflows—always looking for new ways to push the limits of efficiency, scalability, and automation.
